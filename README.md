### 1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbdullahSoftech/event-management-app.git
cd event-management-app
```

### 2. **Backend Setup**
Go to **app.js**, replace this
```bash
app.use(cors({
    origin: 'https://event-management-app.vercel.app',
    credentials: true
}))
```
with this

```bash
app.use(cors({
    origin: 'http://localhost:3000',
    credentials: true
}))
```
Navigate to the backend folder:
```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run start
```
Make sure to configure your MongoDB connection string and JWT secret in the `.env` file:
```env
MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
PORT=5000
```

### 3. **Frontend Setup**
Go to **client folder** and replace the
```bash
https://event-management-app.vercel.app
```
everywhere it is used in react with this
